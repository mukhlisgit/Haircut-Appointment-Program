1.	The customer’s name
2.	The customer’s type of hairstyle
3.	The cost of the hairstyle
4.	A unique id number given to every customer (in case our customers have the same name)
5.	And then a date and time of appointment( calculated from the moment our customers are enqueued)
6.	And other features as well
